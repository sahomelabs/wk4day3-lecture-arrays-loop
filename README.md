// Fizz Buzz
    This is a classic problem that you should get really comfortable solving. If you've solved it before, try to make it more elegant and short.
    Write a javascript application that logs all numbers from 1 - 100.
    If a number is divisible by 3 log "Fizz" instead of the number.
    If a number is divisible by 5 log "Buzz" instead of the number.
    If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 log "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
